GIT --> Client Software , its to enable tracking
Github --> Service provider, its a storage for storing the code

Workflow:
1. create gitbut account ;
	create repositry (project + version history) --> Remote repository 
2. write code on the local machine
	cloning: copy of the remote repository in the machine 
		saved copy of remote repository is called local repository
			Working copy - start working here
			| (staging / adding changes)
			Staging copy
			| (semi finalized) - can undo the code back to the working copy, called as unstaging
			local copy 
			| commit changes , this is the final stage of finalzing code to local repository, aka commit the code to local repository
	Write code --> stage code --> commit code ( local machine repository)
3. Pushing the code to remote repository ( in git hub) 

Setting up in gitbash, authentication from local machine to github
	git config --global user.name dhirajmedapati
	git config --global user.email dhiraj.medapati@gmail.com
	
Low level languages - binary language - machine interaction language 

Python is a high level language, for developing applications, used for software level , application level 
	our code will be converted to ascii language to binary
General purpose language --> can be used in various domains, not just 1 domain, can develop desktop apps, web apps, API, automation scripts, etc
Domain specific language --> like sql, we can do only to code for DB, but not for anything else

Approach to a programming solution is known as programming paradigm , different styles to handle a solution, python is known for being multi paradigm 
	Imperative approach --> how to do something in the code ; object oriented approach( widely used in programming)
	Declarative approach --> what to do, rather than how to do ; functional style programming ( data oriented applications)
	
Python is a dynamic language, no need to define data types (type checked) , it automatically detects the type, unless specified otherwise, its called typecasting where we predefine things and stop the auto detecting the type itself. 


September 9th
=============

	-> Write Code and Develop Apps
		-> Script Mode (100% We Use) (IDE - Keep Code in Files)
		
		-> Command Line Mode (CLI) Use Command Prompt (CMD) (inside python shell) - 
			Code is temporary (Used To Do Quick Checks)

	-> Learning Python (programming language)

	-> Just like english, has alphabets and we forms words and sentences, 
		in similar way we are gonna use python

	-> English language has 26 alphabets (abcd.....z)

	-> python as a programming language has 35 keywords 

	-> Syntax : Rules & Guidelines 

		-> English 
			-> today i take class for 3 PM and 4:30 PM (invalid)
			-> Today i'm going take the class from 3 PM to 4:30 PM (valid)

	-> Keywords : Predefined words, which holds some special meaning to python interpreter

	-> List Of Keywords :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

		False      await      else       import     pass
		None       break      except     in         raise
		True       class      finally    is         return
		and        continue   for        lambda     try
		as         def        from       nonlocal   while
		assert     del        global     not        with
		async      elif       if         or         yield

	-> Keywords cannot be identifiers(name)

	-> Keywords + Syntax = Application / Program

	-> Identifiers : In Python an identifier is the name used to identify

		-> variable
		-> function
		-> class
		-> methods
		-> modules
		-> etc

	-> Rules for Identifiers (naming)

		-> Can Contain

			-> letters (a-z, A-Z)
			-> digits (0-9)
			-> underscore (_)

		-> Must Start with

			-> A letter (a-z, A-Z)
			-> underscore (_)	

		-> NOTE : Cannot be keywords, Cannot Start with Digits, Case Sensitive
				name, Name, NAME (all the different)

	-> Why Python / Key Features Of Python

		-> It's EASY (**)

			-> Syntax 
			-> Execute
			-> Simplicity Of Language (space for indentation)

		-> Fewer Line Of Code (**)

			-> Addition Program in Python it's 3 lines
			-> Addition Program in Java it's 8 lines

		-> Interpreted (Python) vs Compiled (Java) (**)

			-> Performance(execution speed) -> FASTER -> Compiled 

			-> Performance(execution speed) -> SLOWER -> Interpreted

		-> Python is best Prototype Language

			-> Python Development Speed  - FASTEST

				-> Project To Build Custom Requirement : 6 Weeks

			-> Java Development Speed  - SLOWER

				-> Project To Build Custom Requirement : 3 Months

		-> Python is Dynamic typed (**)

		-> Vast Libraries from Community & Open Sources 

		-> Multi paradigm

	-> Variables

		-> Variables are names for memory(RAM) locations

		-> Variables Allow You to

			-> Assign Data
			-> Retrieve Data
			-> Manipulate Data (If Required)

		-> Syntax 

			-> variable_name = value
			   student_age = 30
			   = is called Assignment Operator	

		-> NOTE : In Python, the type of variable can change during the execution

		-> NOTE : A function does a task

		-> type() : Used to specify the data type for a variable

		-> id() : used to show the memory address of a variable

September 10th
==============

-> Output the variables using print()

-> Concatenation : Joining Strings using + operator

	-> + : Concatenation (Strings)
	-> + : Addition (Numeric)

	-> NOTE : Polymorphism (Multiple Forms)

-> Interpolation : Replacing Placeholders with Actual Values

	-> Supports only from Python 3 onwards

				-> >=
				-> <=

		-> Logical Operators 

			-> Used to combine multiple conditions
			-> O/P is True/False (boolean)

                F       F           F         F         T       T     


		-> Membership Operators 

			-> Used if a sequence is present 

				-> in : return True if specified input is in given sequence 
				-> not in : return True if specified input is not in given sequence 

		-> Identity Operators

			-> Used to compare objects (memory)

				-> == used to compare values

			-> is : return True if both objects are same
			-> is not : return True if both objects are not same

		-> Bitwise Operators 

			-> Used in low level 

			-> Used to perform Comparison on BINARY LEVEL (010101001)

				-> AND(&) - Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
                -> OR (|)- Sets each bit to 1 if one of bits is 1

September 11th
==============

-> Datatype

	-> Data types are Categories that define kind of data a variable can hold

	-> Numeric Types 

		-> int : whole numbers 1,2,-10 etc
		-> float : decimal numbers 1.5, 3.5 10.0 etc
		-> complex : a + ib (i is imaginary -> in python it's j)
				   c = 3 + 5j
	
	-> Text Type 

		-> str : string is a sequence of characters enclosed in "" or ''

	-> Boolean Type

		-> bool : Represents True / False	

	-> Sequence Type 

		-> List : Store Multiple elements, separated with , and declared inside []

		-> Tuple : Store Multiple elements, separated with , and declared inside ()

		-> Set : Store Multiple elements, separated with , and declared inside {}

	-> Mapping Type

		-> Dictionary : Stores Key Value pairs (each pair is called item) 
			separated with , and declared inside {}
	
	-> None Type

		-> Nothing i.e represents No value / Absence of value

	-> NOTE : predefined Datatypes are part of python library 

	-> NOTE : User defined Datatypes can be created by user/developer based on requirements

	-> Type Conversion

		-> Convert One Datatype to another Datatype automatically

	-> Type Casting

		-> Convert One Datatype to another Datatype Manually

	
	-> Control Structures 

		-> Used to control the flow of execution 

		-> Types 

			-> Conditional Statements (Decision Making Statements)

			-> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

			-> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)	
		
		-> Conditional Statements (Decision Making Statements)

			-> Used to evaluate condition, execute one block of code if 
				the evaluation is True and execute another block of code 
				if evaluation is False

			-> Types Of Conditional Statements 

				-> if Statement : Run block of code, if the condition is True
				-> if else Statement : Run one block of code, if the condition is True and
					Run another block of code, if the condition is False
				-> elif ladder : Runs multiple if else blocks 
				-> match-case Statement : Alternative to  if else, when you have multiple
					conditions for a single variable (introduced from python 3)

			-> NOTE : indentation refers to spaces at the beginning if line
					that define code blocks (conditionals, loops, classes etc) 

					-> indentation Rules
					   
					   -> Either use a tab or spaces , but not both
					   		-> how many spaces (at least 1) -> python recommended is 4 spaces
					   -> All lines in the same block must have same indentation level
			
			-> NOTE : To make apps more dynamic i.e giving the user to give input 

				-> input() : function used to take input from keyboard as a string 
			
			-> Ternary Operator : Allows you to write if-else in concise form
			value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

	->while loop ; runs a block of code as long as the condition is true, 
			used when we do not know no. of iterations in advance
	-> for loop ; used for iterating over a sequence / used when we know no of iterations in advance
		it is mainly used for working with sequences
	dir()
	used to list all the attributes and functionalities of an object
	if an object is iterable it has '__iter__'

	range()

6th October
===========

	-> Functional Programming

	-> Function 

		-> A function is block of code, which performs some task 

	-> Why Function ?

		-> Functions can help break down complex problems into simpler and smaller manageable tasks 

		-> You can call a function multiple times, which avoid code Repetition => Code Reusability 

	-> Syntax

		def function_name():
			statements	

	-> Define Function & Call Function

		function_name()

	-> Function with parameters 

		-> Using parameters with functions, we can pass Dynamic Inputs for doing tasks 

		def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ....):
			statements	
		
		function_name(argument1, argument2, ....)

	-> Function Based On arguments

	-> In python we can pass arguments to a function in 5 different ways 

		-> Positional arguments

		-> Keyword arguments

		-> Default arguments

		-> Arbitrary Positional arguments (*args)

		-> Arbitrary Keyword arguments (**kwargs)


	-> Positional arguments

		-> These are passed to functions in the exact order as defined in the function signature 

		-> Order / Position matters, the first argument you pass goes to the first parameter, second argument
			we pass goes to the second parameter and so on 

	-> Keyword arguments

		-> These are passed to functions explicitly by specifying name

		-> Order doesn't matter any more 

		-> Improves Code Readability especially when multiple parameters are there 
	
	-> Default arguments

		-> Passing default values to the argument in function signature 

		-> If we pass values to the default argument at function call, 
			default values will be overridden with new values passed 

	-> Arbitrary Positional arguments (*args)

		-> Allows your function to accept any number of arguments 

		-> Used when you don't know how many arguments a function might receive 

		-> * means any => all arguments are captured in a Tuple

	-> Arbitrary Keyword arguments (**kwargs)

		-> Allows your function to accept any number of keyword arguments 

		-> Used when you don't know how many arguments a function might receive 

		-> ** means any => all arguments are captured in a Dictionary


9th October
===========

	-> return in functions

		-> "return" keyword in python is used to give appropriate response 
		when a function is called 

		-> when we don't use return, by default a function returns none 

		-> when using return make sure it's the last statement to be executed

		-> if you have multiple return statements, first will be considered 

	-> Scope Of Variables in functions

		-> Scope : Scope indicates accessibility of an variable

			-> Local Scope

			-> Global Scope 

		-> Local Scope

			-> A local variable is declared inside the function
			-> it's lifetime exists only within the function, while the functions runs
			-> local variables cannot be used outside the Functions

		-> Global Scope

			-> A global variable is declared outside the function
			-> it's lifetime exists outside the function as well
			-> global variable can be accessed inside a function too
			-> if global variable has same name as local, first preference goes to local 
				NOTE : To access global variable, we use globals()
			-> if you want to change a global variable inside the function, we cant by default

	-> Types Of Functions 

		-> Built in functions 

			-> predefine part of standard python library 
			-> no need to create again using def keyword
			-> print(), id(), len(), dir(), input() etc 

		-> User defined functions

			-> user defined functions are created based on custom requirements 
			-> created using def keyword

		-> Lambda functions 

			-> a lambda function is a small, online line function with no name i.e Anonymous functions

			-> NOTE : used for single line expressions 

			-> we use "lambda" keyword to work with lambda functions 

			-> in lambda functions, result of expression is automatically returned

			-> syntax 

				lambda arguments: expression 

		-> Higher Order Functions 

			-> Passing function as an argument to function

			-> map()

				-> Applies a function to each item in the iterable

				-> syntax

					map(function, iterable)

			-> filter()

				-> Filters the items in the iterable, based on condition 

				-> syntax 

					filter(function, iterable)


			-> sorted()

13th October
============

	-> Modules 

		-> A module is simply a python file that contains 

			-> variables 
			-> statements 
			-> functions 
			-> classes 
			-> etc
	
	-> Module Types 

		-> Inbuilt Modules 

			-> Provided as part of standard python library

		-> User Defined Modules 

			-> Created by user itself

		-> External Modules 

			-> Provided by 3rd party vendors 
			-> download and use - https://pypi.org/
			-> download using pip (python package manager)
			-> pip install <package> - win
			-> pip3 install <package> - win

	-> Functions : Reusability for a block of code
	-> Modules : Reusability for a file 
	-> Packages : Reusability for a folder  

	-> Package 

		-> A folder with multiple modules (multiple files)

		-> we need special file __init__.py (start up config)

		-> to use package we go with folder name 

16th October
============

	-> File Operations 

		-> CRUD 

			-> CREATE 
			-> READ 
			-> UPDATE 
			-> DELETE 

	-> Earlier all the activities we did are in non-persistent storage (RAM)

		-> Temporary 

	-> Now we want to work with persistent storage (HDD)

		-> Permanent 

	-> To work with files python has provided 

		-> open() with modes 

			-> r - read : read the data 
			-> w - write : overwrites the data 
			-> a - append : add to existing data 

	-> syntax - 1

		open("file_path","mode"):
			statements 

		NOTE : File is not closed after performing operations 

	-> syntax - 2 (recommended)

		with open("file_path","mode") as var:
			statements 
		
		NOTE : File is closed automatically, after performing operations 
	
	-> Directories Management 

		-> create a folder / Directory 

			-> os module 

	-> Working CSV Files 

		-> Very commonly used in data oriented domain

		-> python has provided "csv" module in standard library
