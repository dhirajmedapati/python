GIT --> Client Software , its to enable tracking
Github --> Service provider, its a storage for storing the code

Workflow:
1. create gitbut account ;
	create repositry (project + version history) --> Remote repository 
2. write code on the local machine
	cloning: copy of the remote repository in the machine 
		saved copy of remote repository is called local repository
			Working copy - start working here
			| (staging / adding changes)
			Staging copy
			| (semi finalized) - can undo the code back to the working copy, called as unstaging
			local copy 
			| commit changes , this is the final stage of finalzing code to local repository, aka commit the code to local repository
	Write code --> stage code --> commit code ( local machine repository)
3. Pushing the code to remote repository ( in git hub) 

Setting up in gitbash, authentication from local machine to github
	git config --global user.name dhirajmedapati
	git config --global user.email dhiraj.medapati@gmail.com
	
Low level languages - binary language - machine interaction language 

Python is a high level language, for developing applications, used for software level , application level 
	our code will be converted to ascii language to binary
General purpose language --> can be used in various domains, not just 1 domain, can develop desktop apps, web apps, API, automation scripts, etc
Domain specific language --> like sql, we can do only to code for DB, but not for anything else

Approach to a programming solution is known as programming paradigm , different styles to handle a solution, python is known for being multi paradigm 
	Imperative approach --> how to do something in the code ; object oriented approach( widely used in programming)
	Declarative approach --> what to do, rather than how to do ; functional style programming ( data oriented applications)
	
Python is a dynamic language, no need to define data types (type checked) , it automatically detects the type, unless specified otherwise, its called typecasting where we predefine things and stop the auto detecting the type itself.

=============

	-> Write Code and Develop Apps
		-> Script Mode (100% We Use) (IDE - Keep Code in Files)
		
		-> Command Line Mode (CLI) Use Command Prompt (CMD) (inside python shell) - 
			Code is temporary (Used To Do Quick Checks)

	-> Learning Python (programming language)

	-> Just like english, has alphabets and we forms words and sentences, 
		in similar way we are gonna use python

	-> English language has 26 alphabets (abcd.....z)

	-> python as a programming language has 35 keywords 

	-> Syntax : Rules & Guidelines 

		-> English 
			-> today i take class for 3 PM and 4:30 PM (invalid)
			-> Today i'm going take the class from 3 PM to 4:30 PM (valid)

	-> Keywords : Predefined words, which holds some special meaning to python interpreter

	-> List Of Keywords :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

		False      await      else       import     pass
		None       break      except     in         raise
		True       class      finally    is         return
		and        continue   for        lambda     try
		as         def        from       nonlocal   while
		assert     del        global     not        with
		async      elif       if         or         yield

	-> Keywords cannot be identifiers(name)

	-> Keywords + Syntax = Application / Program
