SQL - structred query language

DDL - Data Definition Language
DML - Data manipulation (modify) language 
DCL - Data Control Language
TCL - Transaction Control Language

Everything is connected via table format language and is communicated via rows and columns of the table.


DDL - Data Definition Language

Create - can create any database, or table (i.e. new table or even creating rows and columns)
Alter - renaming the things which are already created or add columns or rows to an existing table
Drop - remove the table or column or row or a record but permanently 
Truncate - Remove a row or a column from a table directly with one command ( table headers will be present, values will be removed)


DML - Data Manipulation Language 
Insert - add a new record to the table
Update - update a particular record in the table (more like find and replace in the table)
Delete - we can delete the entire row or a column at a time

DCL - Data Control language

Grant - Give access to the user to a specific row or coloumn or the table as required
Revoke - remove access to the users who already have an existing access to the table / rows / columns

TCL - Transaction Control Language
Save point - assign few blocks of data to a particular name, so that if we update the save point it will go and update the assigned points
Commit - confirm the changes that we made
Rollback - revert back the last made changes, cannot perform rollback twice


Join

Inner join - Common thing between 2 tables
outer join - other parts of the table which is not common between the two table
Left join - only the data present in table A, which is not present in Table B nor the common thing between A and B
Right join - only the data present in table b
Cross join is like mapping between tables based on the information
Self join is mapping the data within the same table
